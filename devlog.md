05/05/2025 - 1:21 PM - Begin project (read over instructions). The implementation of a btree with a main program seems challenging.
the commands would go into the main but I may need to add extra functions in btree for Accessibility. of course these are speculations.
Started simply by initializing the header and blocks in the b tree.

5/06/2025 - 4:30 PM - Looked at header requirements. 3 of the nodes must be implemented from the b tree.
I decided to begin by inputting the commands needed. some of these included file name creation, filename searching
file name Insertion, and printing

5/08/2025 - 11:30 PM -  Exams are upon me and it is hindering my time, however today I worked on the commands in the main function among the main py file. 
Was relatively straight forward, Create, insert, search, load, etc were all used. Made an initial error with the elses and elifs but it was just
syntax and usage.

5/09/2025 - 12:14 PM -  Took time to research the header format of the project. We use an 8s sequence from the magic value provided while two 64 
unsigned integers are used twice.

5/10/2025 - 2:34 PM -  Finished up the commands in main, as well as the implementations among the btree. This was the heaviest load of the day. Individually making sure and testing each function, with debugging statements
set up to identify errors. At first the files were being created but the confirmation was not being outputted. This eventually changed when I introduced a major loop around the program that ends whenever the user inputs m.
I did not realize that a file must already be present before load was used, which gave me silly confusion. All in all. I should be able to wrap up tommorow.

5/11/2025 - 10:46 AM - Final checks and submission. Program works with commands given, including errors. Also updateed the readme as well.
