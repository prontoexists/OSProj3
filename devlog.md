05/05/2025 - Begin project (read over instructions). The implementation of a btree with a main program seems challenging.
the commands would go into the main but I may need to add extra functions in btree for Accessibility. of course these are speculations.
Started simply by initializing the header and blocks in the b tree.

5/06/2025 - Looked at header requirements. 3 of the nodes must be implemented from the b tree.
I decided to begin by inputting the commands needed. some of these included file name creation, filename searching
file name Insertion, and printing

5/08/2025 - Exams are upon me and it is hindering my time, however today I worked on the commands in the main function among the main py file. 
Was relatively straight forward, Create, insert, search, load, etc were all used. Made an initial error with the elses and elifs but it was just
syntax and usage.
